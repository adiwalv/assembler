> 1. Navigate to the right folder with a console.
> 2. Enter :
>```bash
>make 
>```

### Usage
```bash
./assembler file_name [-options] [-h for help]
```

### Options 

> 1. -p : To print source program.
> 2. -s : To print symbol table.
> 3. -i : To print immediate code.
> 4. -t : To print literal table.
> 5. -l : To print lst of the source file.

### To use as a shell command

```bash
make
make install
```
### Usage
```bash
assembler file_name [-options] [-h for help]
```
### To view the lst file, file_name.lst is created when you pass -l
```bash
cat file_name.lst
```
